AWESOMENESS POINTS:
I added a button that shuffles between a day image and night image every 5 seconds because I thought it was a cool idea and taught me about time intervals in javascript. I also added an undo for the paint that removes one shape at a time because the cursor is really delicate and I wanted that. I also added a color preview that is live just to help me understand more how that would work and I thought it would look cool on the webpage. I feel like thats enough to be awesome.

Paper drawing:
I added the paper drawing to my zip file on canvas.

Disclosure:
I used the lecture videos for all the basic stuff. I used ChatGPT to help me come up with ideas for a drawing but didn't really use it for coding stuff as I found it to be not useful (placing things in wrong place... etc). It did help me understand intervals and the color preview though, that's mostly what I used it for.

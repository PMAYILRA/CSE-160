Notes to Grader:
For this assignment, I mostly used documentation to figure out syntax
for html and js because it's been a while since I've coded in either
of these languages. I also used ChatGPT to explain certain things like
parseFloat, getElementById, magnitude, normalize, and cross. Once I understood these
concepts, I coded the rest. -->
